"This project focuses on the recognition and classification of human faces using Python's Haar Cascade library. It addresses a real-world problem by employing computer vision techniques to identify and categorize human faces. The Haar Cascade library, a feature-based object detection method, is instrumental in achieving accurate and efficient face recognition within this implementation."
